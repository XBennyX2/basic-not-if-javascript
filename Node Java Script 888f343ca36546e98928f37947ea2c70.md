# Node Java Script

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a server-side platform for building scalable and efficient network applications. With Node.js, developers can utilize JavaScript to create server-side scripts, command-line tools, and even full-fledged web applications.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome. This allows Node.js to have fast and high-performance execution of JavaScript code.

One of the key features of Node.js is its package manager, npm (Node Package Manager). npm allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries and modules, making it simple to leverage existing code and accelerate the development process.

Node.js is widely used in web development for building server-side applications, RESTful APIs, real-time applications, and microservices. It has a large and active community, with a wealth of resources, frameworks, and libraries available to developers.

Overall, Node.js has revolutionized server-side JavaScript development, providing a powerful and versatile platform for building scalable and efficient applications.

```html
first_name = "Hanna"  this writing style is called snake case
firstName = "Hanna" this writing is called 
```

**primitive data type** 

is changed directly or if we put x = 15 x is gong to be assigned directly to the memory.

writing a string is writing with a single quote

boolean value 

isvalid = true  the first letter is small 

**non primitive data type( reference data type)**

is like an array 

lets say there are two memory when we ask it to store names (hanna and abel)

the values are stored on another memory

it will give a reference to another memory

it will search 

Primitive data types are simple and immutable, directly stored in memory, 

 non-primitive (reference) data types are complex and mutable, stored as references to memory locations where the actual data is stored.

**key words**

const  we use it for something that is not changed

typeof(Name) will give us the data type 

parseint will help us change data types

# J**ava script assignment**

addition, multiplication

exponential power **

y— and —y are difference when using in the print statement or console.log

y— will print the value with out changing it

—y will print after it does the task

=== means that they must be equal even at data type meaning that 3 and 3.0 are different

age must be 18

saving must be 10000

criminal record if yes salary must be greater than 50000

if not  normal person can take the lone

# Function

**Higher Order Functions**

Higher order functions are a key concept in JavaScript, particularly in functional programming. Essentially, a higher order function is a function that can take one or more functions as arguments, return a function as its result, or both.

This is possible because in JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens. This means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, stored in data structures, and even returned as values from other functions.

Higher order functions are incredibly useful for a number of reasons. They can help make code more abstract, thereby hiding implementation details. They can also help to reduce repetition and keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Common examples of higher order functions in JavaScript include .map(), .filter(), and .reduce(), all of which take a function as an argument and use it to manipulate data in an array.

## JavaScript Objects and JSON

JavaScript objects are data structures that can contain data and functions. Data stored in an object is represented as key-value pairs. Keys are always strings, and values can be any valid JavaScript data type, including numbers, strings, arrays, other objects, and even functions.

A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.

Here is an example of a JavaScript object:

```jsx
let car = {
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Camry',
  year: 2020
};

```

And here is the same data represented as JSON:

```json
{
  "make": "Toyota",
  "model": "Camry",
  "year": 2020
}

```

Note the similarities and differences between the two. Both use key-value pairs to represent data. However, JSON requires double quotes around keys, and all keys and values must be of a data type that can be represented as a string.

Objects and JSON are used extensively in JavaScript, particularly in web development. They allow for the storage, transmission, and manipulation of complex data structures in a readable and manageable way.

One common use of JSON is to transmit data between a server and a web application, as an alternative to XML.
